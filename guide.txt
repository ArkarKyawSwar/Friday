Below is the list of things Friday can help the user with.
-Retrieve schedules from Google Calendar(one day at a time)
-Open a new Notepad and write down what the user says for short notes.
-Control Spotify(details at the end of this text).

To wake up Friday, just say "Friday". 
**  Friday must be woke up after each command.

To run main.py, the user must have following files in the same directory.
-A JSON file named "credentials.json" which contains the user's credentials of Google Calendar. See below. 
    {"installed":{"client_id":"XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX.apps.googleusercontent.com",
                    "project_id":"friday-1001",
                    "auth_uri":"https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth",
                    "token_uri":"https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token",
                    "auth_provider_x509_cert_url":"https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/certs",
                    "client_secret":"XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX",
                    "redirect_uris":["urn:ietf:wg:oauth:2.0:oob","http://localhost"]}}
-A JSON file named "token.json" which contains the token for Google Calender access. 
 This file is created automatically when the authorization flow completes for the first time. See below.
    {"token": "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX", 
    "refresh_token": "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX", 
    "token_uri": "https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token", 
    "client_id": "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX", 
    "client_secret": "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX", 
    "scopes": ["https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar.readonly"], 
    "expiry": "YYYY-MM-DDT18:17:59.499166Z"}
-A JSON file named "spotifycredentials.json" which contains the user's credentials of the spotify account. See below.
    {
    "client_id" : "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX",
    "client_secret" : "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX",
    "device_name" : "DESKTOP-XXXXXXX",
    "redirect_uri" : "https://www.google.com/",
    "username" : "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX",
    "scope" : "user-read-private user-read-playback-state user-modify-playback-state"
    }


--------Guide for Spotify--------
- Friday can play songs from Spotify by three voice commands. In other words, the user can give either a certain 
    track's name, album's name or artist's name. If there are multiple albums or tracks with the same name, Friday
    will pick the first one it finds. Voice commands are as follows.
    -To play by track name -> Say "Spotify track <track name>"
    -To play by album name -> Say "Spotify album <album name>"
    -To play by artist name -> Say "Spotify artist <artist name>"

- Friday can control Spotify with four commands.
    -To pause -> Say "Spotify pause"
    -To resume -> Say "Spotify play"
    -To skip -> Say "Spotify next"
    -To go back one track -> Say "Spotify previous"

*** Once Friday recieves the first Spotify command, it will only expect more Spotify commands so the user cannot 
    access other services such as Google Calendar and Notepad. To get out of this, the user can say "Spotify quit".
    This will bring Friday back to normal state.
